## Outroduction

Congratulations, you've made it. You've finally reached the end of this journey. Yet, as you can imagine, it's not the end of all the endings. It's time for you to continue on your own. You now have a great understanding of Three.js and enough experience to venture on your own.

You will stumble on obstacles, but these will be great for you, and you'll feel proud once you pass them. Each impediment is a way of becoming a better self, and you should face them like interesting challenges.

There is still a lot to learn. I've been using Three.js for years, and I keep discovering new technics. Stay humble, look at the latest projects, try to learn from them, and always have eyes for higher prizes. You can always go further and do better. Do not stay in your comfort zone; you won't progress.

I recommend you to experiment. If you find inspiration like an image or a video that you like, try to reproduce it in WebGL. Maybe it's a good idea, perhaps not. Anyway, you'll learn from it. Please find what you like the most, and keep exploring it.

If you create things that you want to show, share them on Twitter or anywhere you like. Even if you think it's small or inadequate, don't forget that there was a time you knew absolutely nothing about Three.js. People will start noticing you, give you advice, and clients or recruiters will soon contact you (if this is what you are looking for).

Speaking of Twitter, don't hesitate to share your projects with the #threejsJourney hashtag or directly mention me [@bruno_simon](https://twitter.com/bruno_simon)

If you have questions, join the public or the members-only discord server, me or the community will do our best to help.

I hope you liked this course and you're happy with what you've learned.

Thank you.
