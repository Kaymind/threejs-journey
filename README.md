## What will you learn?

The course is complete, yet accessible for beginners. We will start by discovering what **WebGL** is and why using the **Three.js** library is a must. We will then discover the various components of Three.js and once the **basics** are acquired, we will move on to more **advanced techniques** to display millions of particles, add physics, add interactions, create a galaxy, animate a raging sea, etc.

At the end of the course, you will have a deep understanding of Three.js and enough experience to **start your own projects**.

As a bonus, we will also learn how to use the 3D software **Blender** to be able to create our own models.
